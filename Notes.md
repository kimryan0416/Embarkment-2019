Many had come to the Forest to seek guidance and shelter, including the mysterious Wanderer, who the Great Tree took pity on. Soon, the Wanderer had become a fellow denizen of the Forest, and all was well…

Alas, peace does not last forever. Suddenly and without pause, the mysterious Corruption appeared and began to take over the Forest! Desperate to prove himself, the mysterious Wanderer rose to the challenge to protect his new home. With the blessing of the Great Tree’s Golden Leaves, the Wanderer sets off to rid the Forest of Flowers from the malicious Corruption.
