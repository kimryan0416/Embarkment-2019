## Concept Document


### Concept Statement:

All was peaceful in the Forest of Flowers, as it was protected by the Great Tree. Alas, peace does not last forever - suddenly and without pause, the mysterious Corruption appears and begins to take over the Forest! Desperate to prove himself, the mysterious Wanderer rises to the challenge to protect his new home. With the blessing of the Great Tree’s Golden Leaves, the Wanderer sets off to rid the Forest of Flowers from the malicious Corruption.

### Features:
* Remove the Corruption’s influence from the Forest
* Shoot Golden Leaves to kill the Corruption’s Brood
* Collect enough Petals to plant Flowers that help reduce big groups of Brood
* Evade the onslaught of sap-thirsty enemies

### Design Goals:

#### Strategic
The Corruption’s brood come with a large variety of enemies, each with their own unique set of abilities and attacks. Some enemies may dive straight towards the Wanderer, while others may wait for the opportune moment. The player must be able to not only know when to shoot and when to evade, but also when to use Flowers to reduce big groups of enemies. The Petals that are needed to plant Flowers come rarely, so the player must be smart about where and when to plant Flowers.

#### Feeling of Gradual Improvement
The Wanderer only has a limited amount of health and carrying capacity of Petals at the start. Progressing through the maps allows the player to gain Upgrade Tokens that can be used to improve these characteristics or gain new abilities. As each map proceeds, the player must be rewarded for their efforts and must be able to steadily improve the Wanderer in a way that the player wishes.

### Market Segment:

#### Genre
Embarkment is a Tower-Defense, Real-Time Strategy (RTS) hybrid that encourages the player to think strategically based on the resources, abilities, and space available to them.

#### Platforms
Embarkment is intended to be playable on both Mac and PC with standard keyboard and mouse. If possible, support for 2-stick controllers (i.e. Xbox or PlayStation) will be added later.

### Competition:

#### League of Legends
The concept of controlling a single character navigating through a map of enemies is shared with the famous League of Legends game by Riot Games. In this game, the player controls a single unit with various abilities and must reach the enemy’s side of the map to beat the match. Unlike League of Legends, however, Embarkment is a single-player experience that does not rely on online connectivity or multiplayer to play the game.

#### The Binding of Isaac
Both “The Binding of Isaac” and Embarkment, along with many from the two-stick shooter genre, include fighting hordes of enemies and shooting around obstacles. However, Embarkment contrasts this gameplay with brief respites of strategically planning turret placement and vantage points.

#### Bloons Tower Defense
Both Bloons and Embarkment focus on a tower defense gameplay style where turrets are used to kill enemy units. Unlike Bloons, Embarkment focuses on an entity the player can directly control and features bigger maps. Furthermore, enemies in Bloons travel a single path, while enemies in Embarkment can move in different directions.

#### Balloons in a Wasteland
Both games attempt to combine the action of a shooter with the strategy of constructing defenses. Embarkment’s top-down view makes aiming, avoiding enemies, and placing turrets much less trivial by giving players another dimension to work with. This makes both the action and the strategy more intricate, allowing for deeper gameplay.


Unique Selling Points:

Continuous Waves: 
In most tower defense games, waves of enemies are discrete groups that players can call in once they’ve set their defenses. Embarkment will instead oscillate from moments of high enemy spawning to brief moments of calm without the control of players. This forces players to think on the fly and makes taking the time to set up turrets a tense gamble.
Crawling Defense: 
Embarkment will include situations where players must destroy the source of the corrupted enemies to complete the level. As simply running to the spawn alone will get them killed, players must instead plant defensive turrets to survive the incoming hordes and move their defenses forward when they can. This keeps them engaged in a flow of defensively regaining resources and aggressively charging forward.  
Resource Management: 
When the enemies are destroyed by players, some of the dead enemies will turn into biomass which is needed by players to build new turrets. However, biomass might appear closes to enemies that are still alive; therefore, players must make wise decisions whether to collect the biomass risking losing lives or to run away from enemies and play safe.
